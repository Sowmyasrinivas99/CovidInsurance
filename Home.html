        <h3 style="color:aliceblue;"><u>Health Insurance for Coronavirus (COVID 19)</u></h3>
        <p><pre style="color:#faebd7;">               2020 will be remembered as a crucial time in history.Half the year has gone by,and the pandemic is still looming<br> around.We’ve all evolved from being extremely fearful of the unknown to now learning how to live with it.This is the new normal<br>as we all say today.On the surface of it, it may seem like things are slowly easing into normalcy but the reality on ground is<br> very different. In India specifically, cases are still increasingly rising. Currently at more than 1.3 million confirmed cases<br> and India now being the 3rd worst affected country in the world, it is now more crucial than ever to take necessary precautions <br>to ensure we’re in the pinkest of both health and wealth.</pre></p>
        <p><pre style="color:#faebd7;">               The coronavirus hasn’t only brought to life a contagious virus but, also other repercussions such as financial <br>instability and the global economic slowdown. This evidently means you don’t only have to protect yourself from the virus and<br> other illnesses but, also ensure you are financially secure.That’s why, today more than ever; getting a health insurance for<br> COVID-19 is almost as necessary as it is for you to wash your hands! A coronavirus health insurance will help you manage<br> your healthcare expenses and ensure you aren’t faced with any financial emergencies at such a time.</pre></p>
